# Toyota_used_car_analysis
This repo will guide you through the basic analysis, EDA and the prediction in the price of Toyota used car.
# What the project is about?
The main objective of this project is to analyze the Toyota used cars data, handle missing values, perform data preprocessing, visualize and predict the price of the dataset.   
The data has been visualized using Scatter plot, Barplot, Histogram, ECDF plot, Distribution plot and Box plot.
# Codes:
1. Data Analysis using NumPy and Pandas
2. Familiarity with Matplotlib and Seaborn
3. Data visualization with Barplot, Scatter plot, Histogram, Distribution, Boxplot and ECDF by adding a categorical column as hue where it's required.
4. Check missing values and check rows and column's information
5. Perform data preprocessing
6. EDA using groupby
7. Barplot based on specific columns (model, transmission, and fuelType)
8. Predict the 'price' using ML method
